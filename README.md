# customizable_dial_widget

The goal of this project is to provide a C++ / Qt dial widget that can easily be incorporated into any project.  

The DialWidget class contains the core functionality required to display a simple dial.  Create customized dials by inheriting the DialWidget, setting the values, and optionally overriding how it is rendered.

Launching the provided demo brings up a simple desktop application with several example dials.
