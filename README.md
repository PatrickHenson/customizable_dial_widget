# customizable_dial_widget

The goal of this project is to provide a C++ / Qt dial widget that can easily be incorporated into your project.  

Launching the provided demo brings up a simple desktop application with several examples.

The base class, DialWidget, contains the core functionality required to display a simple dial.  Additional classes exist to demonstrate the ability to generate a range of custom controls by expanding upon the DialWidget.
